      Two part of data or text line can be seen.ie.Movie lines and conversation lines.
     

# Framework Version:
     Though V2 of tensorflow is sophisticated, Practicing codes with v1 gives an elaborated idea as being naive programmer as such as that it is essential
     
# Code Implementation:
       1.Data Import and Text cleaning
       2.Bahdandau Attention Mechanism
       3.Inference 
       5.Training 
       6.Evaluation
       
# REference:
        All the credits goes to Ms.Abonia who had run the implementation and put all those of her work in github for public refer.
        The ink to her repository:https://github.com/Abonia1/Seq2Seq-Chatbot/tree/master/Notebook
        And Same implementation with v2 of tensorflow is available here.

# Detailed explanation for each and every step of code implementation is available at the github link owned by Ms.Abonia
